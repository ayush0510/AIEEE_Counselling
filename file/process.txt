The counselling procedure is divided into two stages:-
Main Counselling and Second Round of Counselling     
Main Stage Councelling- In the main stage students fill Form-1 online.
In accordance to the choices submited by the student seats will be alloted to the students.
Second Round of Councelling-In order to be considered for the dropout seats, candidates must also submit Form 2 on-line indicating their choices for institutions only.
For the candidates who failed to get an offered seat against Form 1, the Form 2 will be processed for allotment of the institution for admission without branch.
The branch will be allotted later by the institution where admitted with due consideration of merit among the students joining it.
